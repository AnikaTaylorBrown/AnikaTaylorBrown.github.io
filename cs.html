  <p class="explaination"> Completed a minor in Computer Science / Mathematics with NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, gaining a strong understanding of the priciples of computer programming in Java and the use of various data structures. I have gained research experience interning UCSF, where I conducted various literature reviews. I have since worked to apply this foundational knowledge to the VFX industry. I am constantly striving to continue to expand my knowledge in computer science and in programming, including learning HTML and CSS in order to create this webpage. <!--Currently participating in Open Science Data Repository(OSDR) working group, utilizing my CS background to contribute to research on AI/ML / Hardware.--></p>

     <h3>Imaging & Color Science</h3>
  
     <P> I have gained an extensive understanding of the theory behind digital and analog imaging science. This includes the principles of geometric and photographic optics, photometry, sensitometry, colorimetry, and image processing. I have gained experience in the operation of various cinema cameras (Arri, Canon, Blackmagic) as well as loading 16mm film. </P>

    <P>As a certified user of DaVinci Resolve's Color Grading Software, I have gained a strong understanding of color management and the overall color pipleine. With expereince conforming timelines, balance clips, and preforming complex grades, this knowledge has aided me in the navigation of the visual effects color pipeline.</P>
