     <h3>On Set Data Acquisition</h3>
     <P>I have gained expereince in a large variety of data acquisition processes and techniques. I have preformed witness camera operation using a Blackmagic camera on a major motion picture for camera tracking and element capture purposes. I have undertaken camera notetaking during lens gridding, aided in maintaining a witcam database, and aiding in obtaining lighting reference onset (grey/chrome spheres). I have also learned the techniques of photogrammetry, from image capture through to processing. </P>

     <h3> CG </h3>
     <P>Trained in 3D modeling software Autodesk Maya, with knowledge extending to UV mapping, textures, lighting, Arnold rendering as well as some knowledge of rigging and animation. I have been working to gain familiarity with creating simulations using Houdini. I also have some experience navigating Unreal Engine and have experience using the software to create envoironments for use in Virtual Production as well as set up of the n-display within the scene.  </P>
